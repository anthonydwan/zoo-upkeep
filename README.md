# Zoo Upkeep (basic CRUD project)

This is a project which is part of the Odin Project curriculum. This web project is a twist on a basic inventory management system. The aim is to familiarise with backend web development with the use of MongoDB/Mongoose, Express and Node. Throughout development, I will also be using Jest to implement TDD workflow.

In this project, I have also learnt to set up the configuration of nodemon, typeScript and Jest so that I could have a smooth workflow throughout.
